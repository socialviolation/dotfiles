# Dotfiles Sync Command

Sync changes from this dotfiles repository to the host system.

## Steps to Follow:

### 1. Pre-sync Verification
Check if there are uncommitted changes in the dotfiles repo:
```bash
cd ${HOME}/dev/dotfiles
git status
```

If there are uncommitted changes, show them to the user and ask if they want to proceed with committing.

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
cd ${HOME}/dev/dotfiles
git add -A
git status  # Show what will be committed
```

Ask the user for a commit message, or generate a concise one based on the changes.

```bash
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push
```

If the push fails (e.g., behind remote), inform the user and STOP. Don't force push.

### 3. Pull Changes to Home Directory
```bash
yadm pull
```

If there are merge conflicts:
- Show the conflicts to the user
- Ask if they want to force overwrite with `yadm reset --hard origin/master`
- Or if they want to manually resolve conflicts first
- **NEVER force reset without user confirmation**

### 4. Post-sync Verification

Check for common configuration issues:

**A. Shell Configuration:**
```bash
# Verify zsh plugins are installed
ls -la ~/.zsh/plugins/
```
Expected: `fast-syntax-highlighting`, `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-completions`

If missing, suggest running: `yadm bootstrap`

**B. Neovim Configuration:**
```bash
# Check if lazy.nvim plugins directory exists
ls -la ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/
```

If missing or broken, suggest:
- Removing `~/.local/share/nvim/` and reopening nvim to reinstall plugins
- Running `:Lazy sync` in nvim

**C. Tmux Configuration:**
```bash
# Check if tmux plugin manager exists
ls -la ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/
```

If missing, suggest:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
# Then in tmux: Ctrl+Space + I to install plugins
```

**D. Powerlevel10k:**
```bash
# Check if p10k is installed
ls -la ~/.powerlevel10k/
```

If missing, suggest running: `yadm bootstrap`

**E. File Permissions:**
Check that bootstrap script is executable:
```bash
ls -la ~/.config/yadm/bootstrap
```

If not executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/yadm/bootstrap
```

**F. Platform-specific Files:**
Check current platform:
```bash
uname -s
```

- On Linux: `.Brewfile##os.Darwin` should exist but not be symlinked to `.Brewfile`
- On macOS: `.Brewfile` should exist as a symlink to `.Brewfile##os.Darwin`

Verify with:
```bash
ls -la ~/.Brewfile*
```

### 5. Final Report

Provide a summary:
- ‚úÖ Changes committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ yadm pull completed successfully
- ‚úÖ All configurations verified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any issues found and how to fix them
- üí° Suggestions (e.g., "Restart your shell to apply zsh changes")

## Error Handling:

**If git push fails:**
- Check if behind remote: suggest `git pull --rebase`
- Check if authentication failed: suggest checking SSH keys
- Never force push without explicit user permission

**If yadm pull fails:**
- Show the error message
- Check for conflicts with `yadm status`
- Ask user how to proceed

**If verification finds issues:**
- Offer to fix them automatically (with permission)
- Or provide clear instructions for manual fixing
- For missing plugins/tools, suggest running `yadm bootstrap`

## Post-sync Recommendations:

After successful sync, remind the user:
1. **Restart shell** if `.zshrc` or shell configs changed: `exec zsh`
2. **Reload tmux config** if `.tmux.conf` changed: `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`
3. **Sync nvim plugins** if nvim configs changed: Open nvim and run `:Lazy sync`
4. **Reload alacritty** if terminal config changed: No action needed (auto-reloads)

## Safety Checks:

- **NEVER** force push without user confirmation
- **NEVER** run `yadm reset --hard` without user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** show what will be committed before committing
- **ALWAYS** show errors clearly and ask for guidance
- If anything looks wrong, **ASK THE USER** before proceeding
